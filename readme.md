## Features
- In-memory and persistent storage
- ACID-like transaction support

## Installation
```bash
go get github.com/codrion/gokv
```

## Quick Start
```go
db, err := gokv.Open("path/to/database")
defer db.Close()

// Write operations
db.Set("key", "value")
db.Delete("key")

```

## Performance
